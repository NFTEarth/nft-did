Reputation use cases for NFTs on Layer2 Ethereum networks

Summary of AttestationStation:
This repository is for use of reputation applications in conjunction with Optimismâ€™s AS (AttestationStation) smart contract.

What are attestations? They are a form of statements someone who is the person/entity that attests something and are about someone or some entity which is the receiving subject of said attestation. This tool can be highly useful in determining on-chain behavior, use with DAOs, intertwined into DeFi applications and so forth. Both qualitative and quantitative attestations are possible to be used.
